1) Make a program in which store rollno of 3 students in a set and names of 3 students in a queue and print roll no
along with name as follows
     101  abc
     102  def

2) Make a stack of 3 names where entered name by the user to be searched in the stack . If it exists print message
as name found otherwise print search not successful.

3) Make a queue in which store names of 3 students and take a name from user and if name exists in the queue print
the "Search successfull" otherwise print search unsuccessfull.

4) Take a string from user and print the reverse of the string using stack.

5) Make a linkedlist of 3 nodes where numbers are stored , search for the number entered by user. 

6) Program to convert any decimal number to binary number.

7) Write a program to get maximum number from the array.

8) make a program to delete the first node from linked list.

9) Write a program to get the maximum value from the linked list of 3 nodes.


create a program which allocates memory dynamically for character array and store 5 charachers in array
and print it.

create a program which allocates memory dynamically for float array and store marks of 5 students in array
and print average of it.
